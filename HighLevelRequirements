Every time a student wants to get in or out, he/she MUST swipe his/her student card on the card reader device at the door. 
The student ID number and the timestamp MUST be sent to the system and saved to a database. 
These records MUST be stored for 5 years.

At any time, an authorized person (admin) MUST be able to see the history of the SUN Lab access, and to browse the list of students, 
filtered by date, by student ID, and by time range.
There MUST be a GUI for the authorized person to perform the browse and the search.

The system MUST be able to be extended in the future to support multiple types of users
(students, faculty members, staff members, janitors) and the following additional operations:
activate, suspend, and reactivate an ID via an admin account.
